# How to use

1. **Open in Colab**: Click on the 'Open in Colab' badge in the README file to open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Run the Notebook**: Once the notebook is open in Colab, you can run it by clicking on the 'Runtime' menu and then selecting 'Run all'. This will execute all the cells in the notebook.

3. **Enter a Pokémon Identifier**: When prompted, enter the name or ID of the Pokémon you want to search for. The script will then fetch the data for that Pokémon from the PokeAPI and display it.

4. **View the Results**: The details of the Pokémon, including its name, ID, type, and abilities, will be displayed in the output.

Remember, this is a learning project and it might have some bugs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
